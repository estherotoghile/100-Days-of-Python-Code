# Day 2 – Tip Calculator

Welcome to my Day 2 project from the Udemy course  
**"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu**

In this project, you’ll find a simple **Tip Calculator** built using Python.

## Project Description

This Tip Calculator helps you split a restaurant bill evenly, including a tip percentage of your choice. It asks the user for:

- The **total bill** amount
- The **tip percentage** they’d like to give (e.g., 10, 12, 15) 
- The number of **people** sharing the bill

Then, it calculates and displays how much each person should pay.

## Learning Points

- Taking user input with `input()`
- Converting strings to numbers using `float()` and `int()`
- Using basic arithmetic operations
- Formatting numbers to 2 decimal places
- Printing clean and user-friendly output
- Using f-strings to efficiently insert variables and different data types into strings — cutting down on manual string concatenation
