# Day 3 - Treasure Island Adventure Game

Welcome to my Day 3 project from the Udemy course  
**"100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp" by Dr. Angela Yu**

In this project, you’ll find a simple text-based **adventure game** built using Python.

## Project Description

This Treasure Island game is an interactive story where the user makes choices at different stages to find hidden treasure.
The player is prompted to:

- Choose a direction at a crossroads ("left" or "right")

- Decide whether to swim across a lake or wait for a boat

- Choose a door ("red", "blue", or "yellow") to find the treasure

Each decision affects the outcome — some choices lead to winning, others lead to Game Over!

## Learning Points
- Taking user input with input()

- Using .strip().lower() to clean and normalize user input

- Implementing control flow using if, elif, and else

- Creating nested conditional statements

- Building an interactive experience with printed text

- Using multi-line string art (print(r'''...''')) to make the game visually engaging
