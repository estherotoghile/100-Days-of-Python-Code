# Day 5 - Password Generator

Welcome to the **PyPassword Generator** project. 
This is a simple Python application that allows you to generate a secure password by customizing the number of letters, symbols, and numbers. 
It's a fun and useful tool for creating strong passwords for your accounts.

## Project Description
This Python project is a Password Generator that interactively prompts the user for the number of letters, symbols, and numbers they want in their password.
Based on the input, the program generates a secure and randomized password by selecting characters from predefined lists and shuffling the result. 
It leverages core Python concepts like lists, loops, random module, and string manipulation to complete the task.

## Learning Points

- Random Module: Used random.choice() to select random characters from predefined lists.
- User Input: Handled user input with input() and converted it to integers with int().
- Lists: Stored characters in lists and built the password by appending random selections.
- Looping: Used for loops to repeat character selection based on user-defined quantities.
- Shuffling: Utilized random.shuffle() to mix up the password characters for randomness.
- String Manipulation: Converted the list of characters into a single password string with ''.join().
- Password Logic: Implemented logic to generate a password based on user input for letters, numbers, and symbols.
- Output: Printed the generated password using formatted strings with print().
